Those who suffer from speech disorders, autism, malformed respiratory organs, anxiety, or intellectual disabilities may not always be able to communicate verbally. This presents a problem in emergency situations. Currently the only way to communicate with a professional at a dispatch center is to call 911. Those who cannot communicate this way need a method to contact emergency services that is appropriate for them. Blue&Red fills this need by allowing people to communicate with 911 both by letting users type messages and by letting phones automatically relay relevant information (name, location, etc..) to dispatch centers.
