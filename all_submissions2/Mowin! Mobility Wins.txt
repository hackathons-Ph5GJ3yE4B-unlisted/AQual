Inspiration

People with low mobility needs information to move from point A to point B in a City, and in most of the cases, this information is out of reach for them. People with no mobility issues can provide the information. Mowin comes from intersecting the 2, a platform where everyone can add information that helps the mobile impaired navigate in the city safe and easy.

What it does

Mowin is a platform where mobile impaired can plot routes from point A to point B taking into consideration their needs (ramps, elevator, large sidewalks, railings). The information is supplied by everyone - either mobile impaired or not.

How we built it

Started with the needs from the people with mobile impairment, then exchanged and debated ideas within the team. We haven't built a PoC or a demonstration of the idea as yet, it is at "concept" stage.

Challenges we ran into

Finding the right coder.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Great feedback from family and friends when we presented the idea.

What we learned

Putting ourselves in the shoes of people with mobile impairments and seeing mobility from their perspective and their challenges.
