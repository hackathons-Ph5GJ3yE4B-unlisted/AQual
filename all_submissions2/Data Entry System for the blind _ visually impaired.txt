Description

VISION 2020 was launched by WHO to address the problem of global eye health. With the world population aging it is estimated that by 2050 there will be approximately 400 million people with eye health problems and visual impairment. To provide a sustainable solution for the blind, we have developed an intuitive data entry system. It was implemented in an app titled "BlindSMS" that is a note taking and SMS solution for the blind / visually impaired.

The salient features of the system are:
- Easier to learn than Braille
- The blind can actually learn the shapes of the characters with this system
- Can be used in a noisy environment when speech to text recognition fails
- No special hardware required
- Works on any hard key mobile phone
- Uses an intelligent algorithm so that the order of pressing the keys to stroke the characters is not important. The user can stroke an 'A' for example by pressing the keys in any order.

The system has been repurposed for any touchscreen mobile phone with the screen divided into a 3x3 soft key grid. A keyboard on/off voice command from the user switches on/off between the soft keyboard(for data entry) and normal touchscreen operation.
