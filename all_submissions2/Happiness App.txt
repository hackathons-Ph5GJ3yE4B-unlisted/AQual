Inspiration

The World Health Organization estimates the number of people affected by depression around the world at about 300 million. In general, the disease affects women more than men. We found that psychological counseling is expensive, So we try with this application to spread happiness to depression patients for free, using a short and simple text and visual content filled with meditation with the addition of an emotional formula. Mixed with interests so that the user feels that the message is for them and not a random message, and we help those who need more support and health care after Covid 19, there are a lot of things we have done to take care of the mental health of our users and help a lot of people who need more support and care during the previous period

We have more than 60% of our clients from Africa and we are looking forward to targeting more of that continent because the number of depression patients there exceed 30 million suffer from depression
