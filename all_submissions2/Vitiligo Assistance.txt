What is the Idea?

Provide a easy to use customized local treatment to blend in Vitiligo spots on skin, especially in early stages

Potential Impact of the idea

About 1% of the world’s population has a skin condition called Vitilogo, which is characterized by skin loosing pigmentation. In some populations it maybe as high as 2% to 3%. Vitiligo may result in psychological stress and those affected are sometimes stigmatized.

What inspired to have this idea?

The change in appearance caused by vitiligo can affect a person's emotional and psychological well-being and may create difficulty in becoming or remaining employed, particularly if vitiligo develops on visible areas of the body, such as the face, hands, or arms.

How this could be implemented?

The goal is to have a custom applicator, which can read the skin condition (texture, color, tone, etc) and create a lotion real time that is customized to an individual’s skin color. This is supported by an easy to use applicator that can apply the lotion without spills or causing mess.

Tools: Tablet, mobile application

Algorithm: Machine Learning using computer vision, IoT solution for sensing skin conditions, mobile applicator, system design for designing the applicator
