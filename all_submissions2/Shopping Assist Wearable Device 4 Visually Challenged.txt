What's next for Shopping Assist Wearable Device 4 Visually Challenged
What is the Idea?
Provide an easy shopping solution for Visually Challenged people in store through a wearable device which scans the product barcode and reads out the product information real time. Also, it suggests if the product suits the shopper based on facial data points already collected.

Potential Impact of the idea
The World Health Organization reports that, as of 2020, there were approximately 2.2 billion visually impaired (VI) or blind individuals globally. The degree of severity varies from person to person.

What inspired to have this idea?
Historically, cosmetics has played in women's consumer culture (as) a means of self-reinvention and transfor­mation, and allow women to articulate different aspects of the self. However, there is not much happening on cosmetics for visually impaired individuals

How this could be implemented?
Barcode is scanned with the wearable device and the device reads out the information about the product. Based on the facial data points that are already collected, Virtual try On is processed and audio feedback is provided, if the product suits the shopper. Through Virtual Make Artist programmed, alternate products can also be suggested.
