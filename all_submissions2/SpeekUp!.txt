Inspiration

The World is changing! And in a constantly changing world, being able to adapt easily and find new solutions is challenging for everyone. This is why we are here to SpeekUp!

What it does

SpeekUp! is a digital fast access tool created for immediate interjection in digital conversations. Easy to use and always at hand, it becomes the voice of thousands of people with speech impediments who want to actively participate and contribute further in today's business, education, and society.

How we built it

Designed as a user-friendly interface, that can be accessed from both Desktop and Mobile, SpeekUp! allows you to use already preset buttons in a user-friendly drag-and-drop configuration.

Challenges we ran into

The time constraint came out as the biggest challenge we had to face.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We succeeded in building a proof of concept containing words and expressions that are mostly used to catch attention when typing is not noticed or more time is needed for typing in other tools.

What we learned

This can be your voice! Speekup!

What's next for SpeekUp!

An expanded version would allow for voice selection, localization, and button content customization.
