Inspiration

People with various disabilities are much stronger than the average person.
But even strong people have problems, and the Volunteer app is one of the ways to help.

Let's say I have some problems with movement, but I need to change apartments.
I need help with moving. I create a task on the map, add a description and the task is added to the shared pool of tasks.
Any volunteer can select this task on the map and help me.

What it does

First, you need to register and choose a role: you are a volunteer or you need to help with something.
Then create task OR take task on a map.

How we built it

We build API service and IOS mobile app.
API deployed via Heroku (https://objectiver.herokuapp.com/swagger/index.html)

Challenges we ran into

Time was our enemy.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We have strong skills with back-end development, and creating "another web service" was easy like a lemon squeeze.
But building a mobile app for the first time was a challenge. We built it from zero to hero.

What we learned

It was our first IOS app.
We learned how to build a mobile app via SwiftUI and integrate a map via MapKit

What's next for Volunteer

Bug fixing

Audio and voice support for blind people

More gamification (different points for different tasks, achievements)
