Inspiration

One of my neighbor’s kids had the problem was that she was not able to clearly speak what was in her mind due to her speaking problem.

And that's how our idea came into the picture and we took up this challenge as to how we can make it more accessible for her to clearly express herself and her thoughts.

What it does

Studies across different languages and age groups have found that around 50 words account for 40-50% of our daily communication. 100 words account for 60%, and 200-400 words make up 80% of the words we use every day. Core words are usually verbs, adjectives, and pronouns, and are less likely to be nouns.

By giving AAC learners quick access to these core words, we’re providing them with a powerful tool to communicate whatever they want to say. Rather than relying on preprogrammed sentences or phrases such as “I want” and “I see”, they can choose from a relatively small set of words to create their own sentences. They can express a wider variety of ideas, and work on grammar.

How we built it

We built it using React and Microsoft Azure Text to Speech API

Challenges we ran into

Finalizing the design proved to be difficult

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to help Jasmine was our biggest accomplishment

What we learned

The problems faced by people facing speaking difficulties

What's next for Inclusive Speech App

We would like to make an iPad app.
