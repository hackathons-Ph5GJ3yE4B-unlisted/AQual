Inspiration

We are inspired by the complexity of this challenge, and how we can create a solution that helps broaden innovation in accessibility across ELC, not just for new products but also the entire collection of existing goods and services. Instead of a single solution, we’re proposing a holistic service that connects employees, customers, and experts in accessibility to rally around human-centered innovations.

What it does

ACT (Accessibility Companion Tool) is a platform to find and evaluate products and services. ACT is easily searched and tagged by disability area, product type, and user.

Challenges

The sheer volume of opportunities in the accessibility space! :-)

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our solution itself is also designed with accessibility in mind. For example, our video has closed captioning and our deck is designed for use with screen readers.

What we learned

One of the biggest learnings for our team was to reframe away from a perception of individuals with permanent impairments, and to see the value of expanding our efforts to also include situational disabilities.

What's next for ACT

We hope to partner with ELC to build out this tool. We’re ready to ACT!
