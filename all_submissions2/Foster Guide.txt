Inspiration

We thought of a world where every body could feel equal and connect with one another
despites our numerous barriers
Am a Medical student and everyday when I am on call I came across patients and people with a lot of disabilities and I don't always know how to connect with them

What it does

Foster Guide is a platform where any body can connect and its used to Understand the needs of people
having a disability

How we built it

I built the prototype using figma and the vector component using adobe illustrator

Challenges we ran into

I had a hard time finding out what to build
I also had a hard time getting a coder to code

Accomplishments that we're proud of

I am proud of my design and idea and i hope to find for a coder to implement it

What we learned

we learned on disabilities and increase our knowledge of how to
code equitable and usable apps

What's next for Foster

I plan on getting a coder to code the app and working on a deceived all in one device that can be given to people with disabilities and this device will connect with the app
