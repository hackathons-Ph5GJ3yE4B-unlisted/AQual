Fashion art and beauty have been a powerful tool in expressing identity and unfolding personality, especially among people with disabilities. Whilst big brands and multiple creative houses are embarking the road of inclusivity in the luxury market, accessibility to the marginalised community is still lacking. Moreover, due to the unintended bias in advertising algorithms, fashion brands and beauty marketers sometimes find it difficult to advertise their products through social media giants with the likes of Facebook, Amazon and etc. Hence, I'm creating an apparel-and-beauty focused social media platform catered to the disabled community, whether it is for those with vision impaired or people with disabled motor capability.

I'm creating a social media app "Labelless" to help people with disabilities to stay connected. Since it is designed with accessibility in mind, this is a place where brands and disabled people can form an inner circle more than celebrity influencers, and build relationships which create more trust and closeness.

Some of the features to highlight:

Post enlargement and descriptions: Watch the creative storytelling unfold within the fashion and beauty art — how it's made, why it's made in a certain way, and the story behind it

Interactive comments and chat functionalities: build connection between brands and people with disabilities; understand fashion and beauty from a different perspective

Upload button and personal posts: unearth creative processes of fashion and beauty, and discover talent within the marginalised community

Connections: inner circle which will be able to generate peer-to-peer mental support

Word-to-speech functionality: for descriptions in words, by tapping on this toggle, the descriptions will be read out

Not only does this help to create a better support and understanding of the disabled community, brands will be able to have a better reach to the intended group.
