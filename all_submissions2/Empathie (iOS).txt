Inspiration

I, Jennifer Wong, went through many mental health hurdles and struggled to get the specific help that I needed. I was fortunate to find a relatable therapist that gave me an educational understanding of my mental health, which helped me understand my past and accept it. I was able to afford this access to mental health care and connect with a therapist similar to me, but that's not the case for many racial minorities. I saw the power of mental health education and wanted to spread it to others.

What it does

Takes a personalized assessment of your background and mental health in order to provide a curated and self-guided educational program based on your cultural experiences.

You can journal about your reflections as you learn through watching each video. Videos are curated as an MVP, but eventually, we want to hire therapists to create these educational videos.

How we built it

Challenges we ran into

We had our engineers drop the project or couldn't attend the working sessions, so there were issues with the workload. Also, there were issues with technical feasibility since knowledge on Swift was limited.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Proud that overall, we were able to create a fully functioning app that still achieves our mission. We were happy to get the journal tool completed, which was the most complicated.

What we learned

We learned how to cut scope when we lost engineers on the team.

What's next for Empathie (iOS)

We will get more customer validation about the problem and see if our idea resonates with people. We are currently getting feedback from therapists who work with people of color.

In the future, we would love to partner with schools to provide these types of self-guided services since there's a shortage of therapists, especially for underserved school districts.
