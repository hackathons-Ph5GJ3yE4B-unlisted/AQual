Inspiration

Visually impaired and other individuals with activity limitations may find it inconvenient to browse the internet in a traditional manner so I wanted to create a voice-controlled encyclopedia. Knowledge is meant to be shared and so a chatbot with both voice and text would be more inclusive.

What it does

It is a voice-enabled chatbot that answers questions with a response from the Wolfram API based on a user's query. If that fails it defaults to Wikipedia. Questions are not just limited to general knowledge they can also be scientific

How we built it

It was built using python, flask and the libraries for Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha. Speech recognition is handled in the browser using google's web speech API.

Challenges we ran into

Had trouble getting voice to work in flask, ended up using Javascript on the frontend.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Building a responsive bot.

What we learned

How to build voice-driven web applications

What's next for Phonic Wolf

Add more features starting with AI natural language understanding to make the conversations more seamless.
