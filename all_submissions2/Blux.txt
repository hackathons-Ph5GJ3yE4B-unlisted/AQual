People with disabilities report frequent mental distress almost 5 times as often as adults without disabilities. Of this population, there are approximately 2.1 million people who live with limb loss in the United States. These individuals have difficulties both accessing and using technology and suffer from a lack of effective mental health resources. To mitigate these barriers between individuals and therapists, we introduce a technological intervention that implements a software-only sensing framework. We propose a blow-based cursor control method that allows users to have natural hands-free interactions for effective computer support in art therapy. We also conceptualize a design space for shared decision-making between individuals with disabilities and therapists to make psychological assessments. In addition to being a mental health tool, our cursor design can be extended to other domains such as education, gaming, and other productivity-based tools.
