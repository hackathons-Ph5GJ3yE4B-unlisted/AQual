Inspiration

People may lose mobility not just because of losing limbs but also due to other ailments such as paralysis, Parkinson, diabetes, aging and so on. The self-driving wheelchair is designed to give challenged persons personal mobility, making their lives easier and more convenient. People do not need to concentrate on managing the wheelchair during a ride, unlike with regular or electronic wheelchairs. Instead, people may just get into a self-driving wheelchair, enter their location, and the chair will send the information to the system, which will then return the most efficient route. Following that, it will carry people to their destinations without the need for further instructions.
